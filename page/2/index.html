            So, the other day I was listening to the Rhythm and Pixels Radio ⤴ while working. Some days I feel that 8-bit old game music really goes well with programming, it helps me get into the groove. One of the songs that played caught my attention though:

            I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in! Steam reviews were also overwhelmingly positive and it was not expensive.

            I&rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.

            I&rsquo;ve finished OMORI recently and enjoyed it a lot. The story and narrative are well developed, and some moments were truly moving. Be wary that it&rsquo;s a beautiful but also particularly dark and heavy story about the struggle against depression and traumas that can be very real.

            Dweller&rsquo;s Empty Path is a very short (2-3 hours long) and lighthearted game, but has its contemplative and touching moments too. It is a retro-styled, character-driven, exploration-based RPG Maker game, as we follow protagonist Yoki on a day of her life, trying to clear her mind and get a good night of sleep after waking up from a strange nightmare.

            Em um futuro próximo, existe uma cidade distópica onde grandes corporações dominam o governo, e a população, oprimida, luta para sobreviver a cada dia. Nessa cidade há um pequeno bar chamado VA-11 Hall-A, apelidado Valhalla, que é visitado por pessoas que buscam uma bebida, um pouco de alento e, talvez, uma conversa amiga.

            Quadrinhos são muito mais que super heróis de colante ou garotos de cabelos espetados salvando o mundo. Que tal uma chef de cozinha descontente com sua vida e que quer abrir seu próprio restaurante? Essa é a premissa inicial de Repeteco, a mais recente graphic novel de Bryan Lee O&rsquo;Malley, famoso pela série Scott Pilgrim.
