      <description>“My name is Ann” I&amp;rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&amp;rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.&#xA;From the cover and promotional art (I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the synopsis at all), I thought this was a side scrolling adventure or visual novel of some sort, but Ann is actually an RPG horror game made in RPG Maker.</description>
