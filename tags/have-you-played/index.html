            Rabi-Ribi title screen When you look at the promotional art for Rabi-Ribi, you might mistake it for an eroge, but it&rsquo;s not (I swear). If I had to define Rabi-Ribi in a short sentence, it would be: what a Touhou Project â¤´ game, a bullet hell shooter, would look like if it were a 2D metroidvania.

            The Messenger title screen The Messenger was the first game by Sabotage Studio â¤´, released in 2018. Its plot takes place thousands of years after the events of Sea of Stars, which I played earlier this year. I loved Sea of Stars, so I was very curious to see how The Messenger would compare.

            Dragon Warrior title screen I actually played this in February, but only got around to writing a review now.
I like old-school JRPGs. There&rsquo;s something about their simplicity, straightforwardness and honesty that I enjoy, despite their often repetitive and grindy nature and very simplistic, often irrelevant plots.

            Box art for MÃ´nica no Castelo do DragÃ£o This is another one of those games I played during my childhood and never managed to finish. I must&rsquo;ve been around five or six years old, and I remember renting it from a local video store.

            Two quick reviews for two quick games this time.
Gato Roboto Gato Roboto Gato Roboto is a simple metroidvania with interesting 2-bit (monochrome) graphics and some interesting gameplay mechanics. It&rsquo;s clearly inspired by NES Metroid in its environment and setting, but instead of being dark and mysterious, it&rsquo;s silly and lighthearted.

            After getting this as a gift from a cousin on Christmas of 2023 (so more than a year ago ðŸ˜¬), I&rsquo;ve finally decided to play it. There was a lot of buzz and hype for this game, so I was excited to try it. In a nutshell, Sea of Stars is a traditional turn-based JRPG with heavy inspiration from the SNES classics, especially Chrono Trigger (I&rsquo;ll probably cite CT many more times throughout this post ðŸ˜¬). It&rsquo;s a love letter to these timeless classics, with modern mechanics and sensibilities.

            After finishing U.N. Squadron, I wanted to play something I never played before. A short, old school JRPG seemed like a good choice for the next few days, so I chose <strong>The Final Fantasy Legend</strong>, released in 1989 for the Game Boy.

            I wanted this to be part of the Mini Reviews 1 post to have an SNES game there, but I wasnâ€™t able to finish it in time itâ€™s a hard one. Like the other games in that post, I first played U.N. Squadron when I was a kid, around 8 or so I think. Back then I actually played the original Japanese version, which is called Area 88 (ã‚¨ãƒªã‚¢88), which was based on a manga and anime of the same name.

            During the holiday break I used my Anbernic RG40XXV to play and finish 3 games I had played during my childhood, each one for a different console. It was a little weird playing them on a crisp LED screen, without the CRT TV blurring - they almost felt like different games than the ones I remembered ðŸ˜‚.

            Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom is an old school SNES JRPG. It&rsquo;s grindy, repetitive, and annoying sometimes, but it&rsquo;s charming in its simplicity. It&rsquo;s a 16 bit RPG with an 8 bit soul.
