            Monotype is a short philosophical/horror visual novel about a virtual pet that&rsquo;s made real. I don&rsquo;t even remember when I put it in my Steam library, but I decided to play it as I&rsquo;m trying to play more instead of buying more games.

            By now you know I love indie games, but I have even more consideration when they&rsquo;re made by my fellow Brazilian compatriots. Brazil isn&rsquo;t known as a big game making country, but we do have some gems here. I wouldn&rsquo;t call Minoria a gem, but it&rsquo;s a nice game overall.

            This is definitely an odd one. I was intrigued by the game&rsquo;s propsal as a personality test, and the pretty screenshots in the Steam page convinced me to try it. I love weird games so I knew I&rsquo;d like this one.

            I think I&rsquo;ve already said that, but I love short games with a nice narrative. Grimm&rsquo;s Hollow is a small RPG Maker game that tells a simple and touching story about grief and loss. We follow Lavender, a young girl, as she wakes up in a strange place called Grimm&rsquo;s Hollow.

            I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in! Steam reviews were also overwhelmingly positive and it was not expensive.

            I&rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.

            I&rsquo;ve finished OMORI recently and enjoyed it a lot. The story and narrative are well developed, and some moments were truly moving. Be wary that it&rsquo;s a beautiful but also particularly dark and heavy story about the struggle against depression and traumas that can be very real.

            Dweller&rsquo;s Empty Path is a very short (2-3 hours long) and lighthearted game, but has its contemplative and touching moments too. It is a retro-styled, character-driven, exploration-based RPG Maker game, as we follow protagonist Yoki on a day of her life, trying to clear her mind and get a good night of sleep after waking up from a strange nightmare.

            Em um futuro próximo, existe uma cidade distópica onde grandes corporações dominam o governo, e a população, oprimida, luta para sobreviver a cada dia. Nessa cidade há um pequeno bar chamado VA-11 Hall-A, apelidado Valhalla, que é visitado por pessoas que buscam uma bebida, um pouco de alento e, talvez, uma conversa amiga.
