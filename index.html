            After getting this as a gift from a cousin on Christmas of 2023 (so more than a year ago ðŸ˜¬), I&rsquo;ve finally decided to play it. There was a lot of buzz and hype for this game, so I was excited to try it. In a nutshell, Sea of Stars is a traditional turn-based JRPG with heavy inspiration from the SNES classics, especially Chrono Trigger (I&rsquo;ll probably cite CT many more times throughout this post ðŸ˜¬). It&rsquo;s a love letter to these timeless classics, with modern mechanics and sensibilities.

            After finishing U.N. Squadron, I wanted to play something I never played before. A short, old school JRPG seemed like a good choice for the next few days, so I chose <strong>The Final Fantasy Legend</strong>, released in 1989 for the Game Boy.

            I wanted this to be part of the Mini Reviews 1 post to have an SNES game there, but I wasnâ€™t able to finish it in time itâ€™s a hard one. Like the other games in that post, I first played U.N. Squadron when I was a kid, around 8 or so I think. Back then I actually played the original Japanese version, which is called Area 88 (ã‚¨ãƒªã‚¢88), which was based on a manga and anime of the same name.

            During the holiday break I used my Anbernic RG40XXV to play and finish 3 games I had played during my childhood, each one for a different console. It was a little weird playing them on a crisp LED screen, without the CRT TV blurring - they almost felt like different games than the ones I remembered ðŸ˜‚.

            Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom is an old school SNES JRPG. It&rsquo;s grindy, repetitive, and annoying sometimes, but it&rsquo;s charming in its simplicity. It&rsquo;s a 16 bit RPG with an 8 bit soul.

            There are many old games, particularly RPGs, from the 16-bit era that I want to play, or that I started playing when I was a kid and never saw the ending: Lufia 1 &amp; 2, Final Fantasy 6, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, to cite only a few.

            Some time ago I was spacing out and started thinking how doing combos in fighting games is a little like playing a music on piano. You have to get the inputs/notes right, at the right time, at the right rhythm, otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t connect, it doesn&rsquo;t sound right.

            Monotype is a short philosophical/horror visual novel about a virtual pet that&rsquo;s made real. I don&rsquo;t even remember when I put it in my Steam library, but I decided to play it as I&rsquo;m trying to play more instead of buying more games.

            By now you know I love indie games, but I have even more consideration when they&rsquo;re made by my fellow Brazilian compatriots. Brazil isn&rsquo;t known as a big game making country, but we do have some gems here. I wouldn&rsquo;t call Minoria a gem, but it&rsquo;s a nice game overall.
