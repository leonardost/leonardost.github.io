<p>As a professional software developer, it&rsquo;s impossible to ignore the impact large language models (LLMs) are having on the industry. I toyed with the first versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT â¤´</a> back in 2022/2023 and, apart from it being a novelty and a really good chat bot, I wasn&rsquo;t very impressed at the time. Especially given how often it hallucinated and gave blatantly incorrect responses as if they were correct. GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot">Copilot â¤´</a> was promising, and it did help generate boilerplate code and fill gaps based on prompts. However, I started to get <em>really</em> impressed when I started testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)">Claude â¤´</a>.</p>
<p>Claude is an LLM trained specifically for writing code. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few months now to see how far it can go, and I&rsquo;ve been also checking how other people are using it. Despite my initial skepticism a few years back, I do believe AI can be a huge help for developers, and I believe people who don&rsquo;t know how to use it will be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>I like to do small, pet projects to learn new things. To test and practice using Claude, I decided to create a very simple visual novel game in HTML and javascript, and wanted to see how quickly I could get that done. Long story short, in around 2 hours I had a very simple thing running. You can check it out <a href="https://leotaba.blog/etc/vn">here â¤´</a>.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>For this experiment, I used the <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor IDE â¤´</a> with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.</p>
<p>So this was my initial prompt for Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to create a visual novel game that runs in a web browser using javascript. Create an HTML file and JS script to begin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that I didn&rsquo;t even specify what a &ldquo;visual novel game&rdquo; is. This was Claude&rsquo;s response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help you create a visual novel game that runs in the browser. I&rsquo;ll start by creating the basic HTML structure and JavaScript files. The game will need a way to display text, characters, backgrounds, and handle user interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blew my mind. Claude already &ldquo;knows&rdquo; what a visual novel type game is, and it generated an HTML file with elements to display a background, characters, a dialog box and text, alongside a main game script in javascript. And, incredibly, it worked. I asked it to write some example scenes, and it came up with this:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-u_gq2eNyg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Not too bad, right? Despite the weird flickering broken background image, it runs just fine. I love how it generated incredibly clichÃ© names: Sakura High School, Mei Tanaka and Yuki Sato. These are probably the most generic Japanese names around ðŸ˜‚ in any case, it&rsquo;s a perfectly serviceable setting.</p>
<p>After that, I decided to generate some images to give the &ldquo;game&rdquo; more visual appeal. I really don&rsquo;t know how to use those image generation AIs, so I just went with one that I already knew, Dall-E, which now is <a href="https://openart.ai/">openart.ai â¤´</a> apparently. I just used free credits and generated a blue haired, shy <em>meganekko</em> to be Mei; a brown haired, more assertive type to be Yuki, the class rep; an outside school shot to be the scenario-setting shot; and a classical classroom scenario. I&rsquo;ve put more details about the image generation at the end of this post.</p>
<p>After adding these images to the project, I talked with Claude to make small improvements, like not doing fade-ins and fade-outs between each scene if the background didn&rsquo;t change, moving characters to the left or to the right, small things like that. I also wanted to add some personal lines at the end, so I added some lines for the Developer character at the ending.</p>
<p>This is the final result:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-5veR6XpdQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>

<h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with this small experiment.</p>
<p>If I had to code everything by hand, I&rsquo;d probably easily spend half a day or more doing everything. I&rsquo;d have to think first about how to show the images in the game screen, how to handle user input, how to draw a dialog box at the bottom, how to show the character portraits, etc etc. Each of these steps is not hard, but it demands time and some research. It&rsquo;s code that&rsquo;s at the core of a visual novel game, but it&rsquo;s not the most important part, which should be the story. So I was amazed at how Claude basically generated all of that base code in one go, from the first prompt.</p>
<p>One of the metaphors I read that I thought made a lot of sense is, &ldquo;AI is like a mecha for your brain&rdquo;. It enhances your capabilities. It doesn&rsquo;t always generate usable or correct code, but it does an awesome job at generating boilerplate code and generating simple things that <em>you shouldn&rsquo;t have to spend time doing</em>. I know I can draw a dialog box at the bottom of the screen with rounded corners, so I shouldn&rsquo;t have to spend time actually implementing it and remembering/researching all the related CSS properties. It&rsquo;s also great to discuss different ideas and approaches about how to do something.</p>
<p>I believe that AI will bring a huge productivity boost to many, if not all, areas of knowledge. I&rsquo;m not sure of all the societal impact it might have, but as a software developer, I&rsquo;m really impressed by how far it has come along. And it will only get better/more scary from here.</p>

</p>
<p>I clearly have no idea how to properly use these image generation AIs. I just mess around with prompts, models and pick whatever I think&rsquo;s closer to what I wanted. Sometimes I try to be more specific with the prompt, but I&rsquo;m not sure how that influences the actual generation. For example, for the developer character, I just wanted a black cat with classes, like, an actual cat, not a catgirl. I clearly failed miserably because I only got one image like that. The generated catgirls were cute though, and I really liked this one:</p>

<p>Her uniform doesn&rsquo;t even match Mei&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost the opposite color ðŸ˜‚</p>
<h3 id="scenario-outside-school">Scenario: outside school</h3>

</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like this one, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a Japanese high school <em>at all</em>. But I think it&rsquo;s the less bad one I was able to get.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-classroom">Scenario: classroom</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>scenario, visual novel scenario, background, inside school, classroom, Japanese classroom, no people, student desks, blackboard, daylight, class starting</p>

</p>
<p>This classroom looks <em>really</em> weird, with the desks misaligned and all the way by the wall with the black board. Not to mention all the blurred gibberish written on it.</p>
<h3 id="chacater-cat">Chacater: cat</h3>
