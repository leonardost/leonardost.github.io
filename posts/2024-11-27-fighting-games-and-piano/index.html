<p>Some time ago I was spacing out and started thinking how doing combos in fighting games is a little like playing a music on piano. You have to get the inputs/notes right, at the right time, at the right rhythm, otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t connect, it doesn&rsquo;t sound right. Sometimes you need to improvise, so maybe combos are more like jazz than, say, classical music. More free form, sometimes chaotic and surprising.</p>
<p>By the way, despite liking fighting games since I was a kid, Street Fighter V is the first one that I really decided to practice seriously, fueled by a friendly rivalry. I chose to main <a href="https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Menat">Menat ‚§¥</a> based solely on looks, she seemed like a charismatic character. Little did I know that she was one of the most complicated characters to master üòÖ but she&rsquo;s a lot of fun too. Too bad she&rsquo;ll probably never be in Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with a video of one of the best Menat players in the past.</p>
