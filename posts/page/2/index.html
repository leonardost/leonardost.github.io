            There are many old games, particularly RPGs, from the 16-bit era that I want to play, or that I started playing when I was a kid and never saw the ending: Lufia 1 &amp; 2, Final Fantasy 6, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, to cite only a few.

            Some time ago I was spacing out and started thinking how doing combos in fighting games is a little like playing a music on piano. You have to get the inputs/notes right, at the right time, at the right rhythm, otherwise it doesn&rsquo;t connect, it doesn&rsquo;t sound right.

            Monotype is a short philosophical/horror visual novel about a virtual pet that&rsquo;s made real. I don&rsquo;t even remember when I put it in my Steam library, but I decided to play it as I&rsquo;m trying to play more instead of buying more games.

            (post in Portuguese since this is a scam alert aimed at Brazilians) Sou um usuário ávido do Youtube e geralmente nem percebo as propagandas que aparecem no meio da lista de outros vídeos. Porém, nessa semana uma delas me chamou a atenção: 5 azeites de oliva Andorinha por R$89,90?

            By now you know I love indie games, but I have even more consideration when they&rsquo;re made by my fellow Brazilian compatriots. Brazil isn&rsquo;t known as a big game making country, but we do have some gems here. I wouldn&rsquo;t call Minoria a gem, but it&rsquo;s a nice game overall.

            This is definitely an odd one. I was intrigued by the game&rsquo;s propsal as a personality test, and the pretty screenshots in the Steam page convinced me to try it. I love weird games so I knew I&rsquo;d like this one.

            I think I&rsquo;ve already said that, but I love short games with a nice narrative. Grimm&rsquo;s Hollow is a small RPG Maker game that tells a simple and touching story about grief and loss. We follow Lavender, a young girl, as she wakes up in a strange place called Grimm&rsquo;s Hollow.

            So, the other day I was listening to the Rhythm and Pixels Radio ⤴ while working. Some days I feel that 8-bit old game music really goes well with programming, it helps me get into the groove. One of the songs that played caught my attention though:

            I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in! Steam reviews were also overwhelmingly positive and it was not expensive.

            I&rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.
