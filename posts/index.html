            A short review for a short and sweet anime that I watched some weeks ago. So from time to time I like to watch something that&rsquo;s simple, heartwarming and unassuming, just to feel a little warm and fuzzy inside, especially while having lunch.

            Momodora: Moonlit Farewell is the last installment in the Momodora series, which started all the way back in 2010. All the games in the series were created by Brazilian game designer Guilherme &ldquo;rdein&rdquo; Martins and his team, Bombservice. I always like to bring that up because we Brazilians are still very underrepresented and peripheral in the global game dev world.

            When you look at the promotional art for Rabi-Ribi, you might mistake it for an <em>eroge</em>, but it&rsquo;s not (I swear). If I had to define Rabi-Ribi in a short sentence, it would be: what a Touhou Project game, a bullet hell shooter, would look like if it were a 2D metroidvania.

            The Messenger was the first game by Sabotage Studio, released in 2018. Its plot takes place thousands of years after the events of Sea of Stars, which I played earlier this year. I loved Sea of Stars, so I was very curious to see how The Messenger would compare.

            I actually played this in February, but only got around to writing a review now. I like old-school JRPGs. There&rsquo;s something about their simplicity, straightforwardness and honesty that I enjoy, despite their often repetitive and grindy nature and very simplistic, often irrelevant plots.

            This is another one of those games I played during my childhood and never managed to finish. I must&rsquo;ve been around five or six years old, and I remember renting it from a local video store. Now, with my trusty Anbernic, it was time to complete it and fill that gap in my childhood.

            Two quick reviews for two quick games this time. Gato Roboto is a simple metroidvania with interesting 2-bit (monochrome) graphics and some interesting gameplay mechanics. It&rsquo;s clearly inspired by NES Metroid in its environment and setting, but instead of being dark and mysterious, it&rsquo;s silly and lighthearted.

            As a professional software developer, it&rsquo;s impossible to ignore the impact large language models (LLMs) are having on the industry. I toyed with the first versions of ChatGPT back in 2022/2023 and, apart from it being a novelty and a really good chat bot, I wasn&rsquo;t very impressed at the time. Especially given how often it hallucinated and gave blatantly incorrect responses as if they were correct. GitHub&rsquo;s Copilot was promising, and it did help generate boilerplate code and fill gaps based on prompts. However, I started to get <em>really</em> impressed when I started testing Claude.

            After getting this as a gift from a cousin on Christmas of 2023 (so more than a year ago 😬), I&rsquo;ve finally decided to play it. There was a lot of buzz and hype for this game, so I was excited to try it. In a nutshell, Sea of Stars is a traditional turn-based JRPG with heavy inspiration from the SNES classics, especially Chrono Trigger (I&rsquo;ll probably cite CT many more times throughout this post 😬). It&rsquo;s a love letter to these timeless classics, with modern mechanics and sensibilities.
