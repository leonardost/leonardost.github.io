<p>Yoki from Dweller&rsquo;s Empty Path, a delightful little game developed by Temmie Chang (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tuyoki/">@tuyoki</a>), best known as one of the main artists of indie hit Undertale.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dweller&rsquo;s Empty Path is a very short (2-3 hours long) and lighthearted game, but has its contemplative and touching moments too. It is a retro-styled, character-driven, exploration-based RPG Maker game, as we follow protagonist Yoki on a day of her life, trying to clear her mind and get a good night of sleep after waking up from a strange nightmare.</p>
<p>Yoki&rsquo;s a great protagonist: a strong, calm, kind and introspective person, she takes everything in stride even though she has her own conflicts, internal and external, to solve. I love her cool attitude and how unimpressed (tired?) she looks in many of her portraits and cutscenes. As the game progressed, I really wanted to see more of her story unraveled, but we get just a small taste of Yoki&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Temmie&rsquo;s art and pixel art are wonderful as always, as anyone who has played Undertale can attest. The graphics and characters exude personality, even within a choice of a limited 4 color Gameboy palette and resolution. The music is superb too - it was composed by Temmie and fleshed out by none other than Toby Fox, of Undertale fame. The main theme (&ldquo;Leaves Fill The Path&rdquo;) in particular has been on my mind for some time and it&rsquo;s quite beautiful. It&rsquo;s soothing, adventurous and has a hint of melancholy.</p>
