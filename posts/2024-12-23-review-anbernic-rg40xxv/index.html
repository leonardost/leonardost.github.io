<p>There are many old games, particularly RPGs, from the 16-bit era that I want to play, or that I started playing when I was a kid and never saw the ending: Lufia 1 &amp; 2, Final Fantasy 6, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, to cite only a few. I could download their ROMs and play them on an emulator at any time today of course, but for some reason I never got to do it. It&rsquo;s not complicated, it&rsquo;s not hard to find them, I just never did it for some reason. Maybe in my head it&rsquo;s a hassle to turn the PC on just to play old games.</p>
<p>So when I started hearing about some Chinese handhelds that ran emulators for all classic consoles, I was intrigued and tempted to get one. Retro gaming and portable consoles just seem to be a good combination - you can play games anywhere and at any time, it&rsquo;s very accessible and convenient. After watching a lot of reviews, I decided to buy the <a href="https://anbernic.com/">Anbernic</a> RG40XXV as a treat for myself.</p>

<p>When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was its sleek, Apple-like box. The console itself is also really cool looking, I like the transparent plastic that reminds me of a purple Game Boy Color I had many decades ago. But more than its appearance, what impressed me the most was its build quality.</p>
<p>All the reviews I watched said it was a good quality product, but when holding it in my hands, it felt even better than I was expecting. The D-pad and all buttons feel really nice to the touch, and the 4 inch screen is excellent, with good contrast, adjustable brightness and crisp images. Even the built-in speaker does it&rsquo;s job well, all games I&rsquo;ve tested sounded great.</p>

<p>The console already comes with a linux based OS and the Retroarch emulator installed. The OS is a little quirky but it&rsquo;s serviceable. It also comes with thousands of ROMs for practically all the old consoles, up to even some Playstation games (which take up a lot of space). Speaking of which, the PSX games I tested (Crash Bandicoot, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night) ran flawlessly without a hitch. I know it can emulate even some Dreamcast and PSP games well, but I didn&rsquo;t test them (they&rsquo;re not my main interest anyway). I think everything up to the Gameboy Advance should run perfectly.</p>
<p>This Anbernic is an amazing portable console, but it also has a mini HDMI output port if you want to hook it to an external screen. My eyesight is bad, so even if the 4 inch screen is really good, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to play on a large TV sometimes. I&rsquo;ve tested plugging it to a TV and it worked seamlessly, it was impressive. I also tested connecting 2 PS4 controllers, which are my default gaming joysticks, via bluetooth, and they worked amazingly well. It was like playing on an actual console in front of the TV.</p>
<p>The only downside I could say from these 3 weeks I&rsquo;ve been using it are that the grip is not so ergonomic. Since the console is thin and small, you might not be able to get a good grip to use the D-pad confortably. Maybe the horizontal version, the RG40XXH, has a more confortable grip. For games where you need precise movement, it might take some time getting used to.</p>
<p>In summary, I&rsquo;m really happy with the RG40XXV, and I&rsquo;d recommend it in a heartbeat for any other retro game enthusiasts. I paid around R$550 in total with taxes (~100 USD) and it was totally worh it!</p>
