<p>Monotype is a short philosophical/horror visual novel about a virtual pet that&rsquo;s made real. I don&rsquo;t even remember when I put it in my Steam library, but I decided to play it as I&rsquo;m trying to play more instead of buying more games.</p>
<p>Do you remember tamagotchis? This is what a real-life tamagotchi could be like, if it also had an artificial intelligence that started to question the meaning of its own existence and its relation with you, its parent, that it loves so much.</p>

<p>The story went to places that I really didn&rsquo;t expect it to go. The premise is that we are beta-testing a new kind of artificial pet called a Monotype. It&rsquo;s delivered to your home and we start taking care of it. What does it eat? What does it think? Does it feel? Are you going to be a loving parent or not?</p>
<p>Most of the story is surreal and weird, and sometimes disturbing, just like a nice short psychological horror game should be. There are some choices during the gameplay, but I don&rsquo;t think they actually change the outcome.</p>
<p>This is described as a horror story, but I found it actually thought-provoking and philosophical when the Monotype suddenly questions what they are and if we love them. Because they love us. It&rsquo;s in their programming. Is hard-coded love the ultimate form of love?</p>
<p>The visuals are minimalistic and monochromatic, but still pleasant. I guess it&rsquo;s a trend among horror visual novels, like Milk Inside a Bag of Milk, to be monochromatic, maybe to give a vibe of 8-bit horror, or to show less details and enhance the mistery and fear of the unknown. The music was very low key and minimalistic, just like the graphics, and not too memorable.</p>
