      <description>Grimm&amp;#39;s Hollow title screen - lots of ghosts in this one I think I&amp;rsquo;ve already said that, but I love short games with a nice narrative. Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Hollow is a small RPG Maker game that tells a simple and touching story about grief and loss.</description>

      <description>I wonder what we&amp;#39;ll watch in this theater? I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&amp;rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in!
