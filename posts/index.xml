      <description>(post in Portuguese since this is a scam alert aimed at Brazilians) Sou um usuário ávido do Youtube e geralmente nem percebo as propagandas que aparecem no meio da lista de outros vídeos. Porém, nessa semana uma delas me chamou a atenção: 5 azeites de oliva Andorinha por R$89,90?</description>

      <title>Have you played...? Minoria</title>

      <description>By now you know I love indie games, but I have even more consideration when they&amp;rsquo;re made by my fellow Brazilian compatriots. Brazil isn&amp;rsquo;t known as a big game making country, but we do have some gems here. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call Minoria a gem, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice game overall.</description>

      <title>Have you played...? Refind Self: The Personality Test Game</title>

      <description>This is definitely an odd one. I was intrigued by the game&amp;rsquo;s propsal as a personality test, and the pretty screenshots in the Steam page convinced me to try it. I love weird games so I knew I&amp;rsquo;d like this one.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve already said that, but I love short games with a nice narrative. Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Hollow is a small RPG Maker game that tells a simple and touching story about grief and loss. We follow Lavender, a young girl, as she wakes up in a strange place called Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Hollow.</description>

      <description>So, the other day I was listening to the Rhythm and Pixels Radio while working. Some days I feel that 8-bit old game music really goes well with programming, it helps me get into the groove. One of the songs that played caught my attention though:</description>

      <description>I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&amp;rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in! Steam reviews were also overwhelmingly positive and it was not expensive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&amp;rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.</description>

      <title>Have you played...? OMORI</title>
      <link>https://leotaba.blog/posts/2022-05-09-omori/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished OMORI recently and enjoyed it a lot. The story and narrative are well developed, and some moments were truly moving. Be wary that it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful but also particularly dark and heavy story about the struggle against depression and traumas that can be very real.</description>

      <title>Have you played...? Dweller&#39;s Empty Path</title>
      <link>https://leotaba.blog/posts/2021-08-21-dwellers-empty-path/</link>

      <description>Dweller&amp;rsquo;s Empty Path is a very short (2-3 hours long) and lighthearted game, but has its contemplative and touching moments too. It is a retro-styled, character-driven, exploration-based RPG Maker game, as we follow protagonist Yoki on a day of her life, trying to clear her mind and get a good night of sleep after waking up from a strange nightmare.</description>

      <description>Em um futuro próximo, existe uma cidade distópica onde grandes corporações dominam o governo, e a população, oprimida, luta para sobreviver a cada dia. Nessa cidade há um pequeno bar chamado VA-11 Hall-A, apelidado Valhalla, que é visitado por pessoas que buscam uma bebida, um pouco de alento e, talvez, uma conversa amiga.</description>

      <description>Quadrinhos são muito mais que super heróis de colante ou garotos de cabelos espetados salvando o mundo. Que tal uma chef de cozinha descontente com sua vida e que quer abrir seu próprio restaurante? Essa é a premissa inicial de Repeteco, a mais recente graphic novel de Bryan Lee O&amp;rsquo;Malley, famoso pela série Scott Pilgrim.</description>
