      <description>What a Wonderful World! What a Wonderful World! Brazilian edition cover My first contact with manga author Inio Asano was in the Sol Bookstore â¤´ in the ethnic Liberdade neighborhood â¤´ of SÃ£o Paulo. I was just browsing random manga and the cover of What a Wonderful World!</description>

      <title>Have you played...? Sea of Stars</title>

      <description>After getting this as a gift from a cousin on Christmas of 2023 (so more than a year ago ðŸ˜¬), I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to play it. There was a lot of buzz and hype for this game, so I was excited to try it. In a nutshell, Sea of Stars is a traditional turn-based JRPG with heavy inspiration from the SNES classics, especially Chrono Trigger (I&amp;rsquo;ll probably cite CT many more times throughout this post ðŸ˜¬). It&amp;rsquo;s a love letter to these timeless classics, with modern mechanics and sensibilities.</description>

      <title>Have you played...? The Final Fantasy Legend</title>

      <description>After finishing U.N. Squadron, I wanted to play something I never played before. A short, old school JRPG seemed like a good choice for the next few days, so I chose &lt;strong&gt;The Final Fantasy Legend&lt;/strong&gt;, released in 1989 for the Game Boy.</description>

      <description>I wanted this to be part of the Mini Reviews 1 post to have an SNES game there, but I wasnâ€™t able to finish it in time itâ€™s a hard one. Like the other games in that post, I first played U.N. Squadron when I was a kid, around 8 or so I think. Back then I actually played the original Japanese version, which is called Area 88 (ã‚¨ãƒªã‚¢88), which was based on a manga and anime of the same name.</description>

      <description>During the holiday break I used my Anbernic RG40XXV to play and finish 3 games I had played during my childhood, each one for a different console. It was a little weird playing them on a crisp LED screen, without the CRT TV blurring - they almost felt like different games than the ones I remembered ðŸ˜‚.</description>

      <title>Have you played...? Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</title>

      <guid>https://leotaba.blog/posts/2024-12-28-lufia/</guid>
      <description>Lufia &amp;amp; The Fortress of Doom is an old school SNES JRPG. It&amp;rsquo;s grindy, repetitive, and annoying sometimes, but it&amp;rsquo;s charming in its simplicity. It&amp;rsquo;s a 16 bit RPG with an 8 bit soul.</description>

      <description>There are many old games, particularly RPGs, from the 16-bit era that I want to play, or that I started playing when I was a kid and never saw the ending: Lufia 1 &amp;amp; 2, Final Fantasy 6, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, to cite only a few.</description>

      <title>Fighting games and piano</title>

      <description>Some time ago I was spacing out and started thinking how doing combos in fighting games is a little like playing a music on piano. You have to get the inputs/notes right, at the right time, at the right rhythm, otherwise it doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound right.</description>

      <description>Monotype is a short philosophical/horror visual novel about a virtual pet that&amp;rsquo;s made real. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember when I put it in my Steam library, but I decided to play it as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to play more instead of buying more games.</description>

      <description>(post in Portuguese since this is a scam alert aimed at Brazilians) Sou um usuÃ¡rio Ã¡vido do Youtube e geralmente nem percebo as propagandas que aparecem no meio da lista de outros vÃ­deos. PorÃ©m, nessa semana uma delas me chamou a atenÃ§Ã£o: 5 azeites de oliva Andorinha por R$89,90?</description>

      <description>By now you know I love indie games, but I have even more consideration when they&amp;rsquo;re made by my fellow Brazilian compatriots. Brazil isn&amp;rsquo;t known as a big game making country, but we do have some gems here. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call Minoria a gem, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice game overall.</description>

      <description>This is definitely an odd one. I was intrigued by the game&amp;rsquo;s propsal as a personality test, and the pretty screenshots in the Steam page convinced me to try it. I love weird games so I knew I&amp;rsquo;d like this one.</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve already said that, but I love short games with a nice narrative. Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Hollow is a small RPG Maker game that tells a simple and touching story about grief and loss. We follow Lavender, a young girl, as she wakes up in a strange place called Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Hollow.</description>

      <description>So, the other day I was listening to the Rhythm and Pixels Radio â¤´ while working. Some days I feel that 8-bit old game music really goes well with programming, it helps me get into the groove. One of the songs that played caught my attention though:</description>

      <guid>https://leotaba.blog/posts/2024-02-09-bad-end-theater/</guid>
      <description>I bought this some months ago captivated by its premise: a weird game where you decide characters&amp;rsquo; fates as if in a theater play, with cute, 8-bit aesthetic? Sign me in! Steam reviews were also overwhelmingly positive and it was not expensive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the point in my Steam games library where I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why I have some games - that&amp;rsquo;s the case for this one. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just a a sucker for meganekko. Actually, I think it was because I came across this funny Youtube video and decided to see what else the creator had done.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finished OMORI recently and enjoyed it a lot. The story and narrative are well developed, and some moments were truly moving. Be wary that it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful but also particularly dark and heavy story about the struggle against depression and traumas that can be very real.</description>

      <description>Dweller&amp;rsquo;s Empty Path is a very short (2-3 hours long) and lighthearted game, but has its contemplative and touching moments too. It is a retro-styled, character-driven, exploration-based RPG Maker game, as we follow protagonist Yoki on a day of her life, trying to clear her mind and get a good night of sleep after waking up from a strange nightmare.</description>
