  <section><p>So, the other day I was listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTS4a3XxKvU">Rhythm and Pixels Radio</a> while working. Some days I feel that 8-bit old game music really goes well with programming, it helps me get into the groove. One of the songs that played caught my attention though:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxd6FYuNBrk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I played <strong>Motocross Maniacs</strong> a lot when I was a kid. My mom had the original gray brick Game Boy and, as was customary here in Brazil due to games being really expensive, we had a pirate cartridge. It was one of those that had 101 games in 1, if memory serves me right. There were many interesting games there, and this was one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun and simple motocross game: you command a bike and have to go through 8 stages with increasing difficulty. Each course has ramps, rocks and loops that you have to manouver through, all while doing acrobatics and using your nitros to reach higher places and not let the timer run out.</p>
<p>The nostalgia hit me when I heard the song, which is quite nice and catchy, but I was really surprised when I saw the composers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michiru_Yamane">Michiru Yamane</a> and Tsuyoshi Sekito. Michiru Yamane is of course super famous for her work on Castlevania Symphony of the Night, one of the great game soundtracks. This might have been one of her earlier works at Konami, but it already shows her genius. No wonder I enjoyed the music in this unpretentious little Game Boy game.</p>
